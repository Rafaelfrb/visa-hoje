        <div>A tourism visa (B-2) to the United States allows an individual to enter the country
             temporarily for pleasure or to visit friends or family. 
             The maximum length of stay is typically six months, but it can be extended in certain circumstances. 
             To apply for a tourism visa, individuals must submit a completed application form,
            a passport valid for at least six months beyond the intended stay, and pay a non-refundable fee.
            They may also be required to provide evidence of financial support, a round-trip ticket,
            and a clear purpose for the visit. 
            It is important to note that a tourism visa does not allow for work or study in the United States. 
            Additionally, it is also important to check the US Embassay website regarding the updated rules
            and regulations regarding the visa application process as it may be 
            affected by the current situations.</div>
